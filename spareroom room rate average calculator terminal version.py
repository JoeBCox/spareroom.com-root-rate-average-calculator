# Dev Project Notes:

# Consider moving to a Java front-end but build the front-end bones in Tkinter with Python for now. Python for back-end
# data management whatever language the front-end is written in.

# https://www.spareroom.co.uk/

# Inputs to site necessary: Postcode and Mile-Radius.

# Take one page room prices with these variables and average them into an "area-average room-price" variable.

# Extra input variables to think about: prices-averaged (amount of rooms-prices taken from the site and averaged),
# Weekly/Monthly rent type, To-move-in date, Length-of-stay, Days available, property type, Room amenities,
# Number of rooms, Rooms-for, share-with, age-range, household types (household options), size of household,
# property preferences, misc, keywords. (Basically the sidebar),
# see https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/?search_id=1033109264&

# CEO of Property Deals Insight, Nitin Aggarwal, has asked for an application, however,
# also explore the web-extension option, web-application app, and consider port to mobile app,
# for IOS you'd need to translate Python code to Swift.

# Need to add a tutorial "How to use the application" command.

# in terms of differing prices between pcm and pw, they both have unique abbr titles.
# Respectively: <abbr title="">pw</abbr> and <abbr title="">pcm</abbr>
